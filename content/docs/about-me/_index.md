# About Me

I'm **Yazan Shannak**, Data Scientist @ [Arabia Weather](https://www.arabiaweather.com/) and Data Science Masters student @ [Jordan University of Science and Technology](https://www.just.edu.jo/Pages/Default.aspx)

Python was the first programming language I learned and fell in love with, today I use Python to:

- Analyze data
- Build machine learning models
- Web crawling
- Web application development

Today I mainly work on deep learning models in the field of weather forecast at ArabiaWeather, besides my coursework and thesis at JUST which include Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).

I have always enjoyed exploring the world around me and how everything works, even more I enjoy sharing what I've learned. I've had over a dozen of young students whom I helped learn Python and the basics of web development through CodeCircle's program _Code Caffe_, I've also been a teacher assistant at JUST where I helped graduate students explore new technologies and understand the beautiful art of deep learning.
